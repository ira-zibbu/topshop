This is a little project I made when I was 15, and was the first long program I ever wrote. Written in Java, on Bluejay

It is a text-based interface for a shop, where a series of switch statements allow the user to select items to add to their cart. At the end, a bill is generated with relevant details that are obtained from the user. It isn't anything fancy, but was something I enjoyed making.
